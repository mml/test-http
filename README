Test::HTTP is designed to make it easier to write tests which are
mainly about HTTP-level things, such as REST-type services.  In
particular, with the syntax filter in Test::HTTP::Syntax, it becomes
extremely natural to write HTTP tests:

  use Test::HTTP '-syntax', tests => 9;

  test_http 'echo test' {
      >> GET http://localhost:12345/echo/foo
      >> Accept: text/plain

      << 200
      ~< Content-type: ^text/plain\b
      <<
      << foo
  }
